# Category Theory and Functional Programming
### Notes for a future course

This repository contains notes on Category Theory (CT)
and Functional Programming (FP). The goal is to introduce
Category Theory in a practical manner by showing
how it relates to Functional Programming.

While most notes on Category Theory or Functional Programming
focus on programming languages such as Haskell or Scala,
we instead use Julia.
Julia is an easy language to learn and does not have a
"direct" functional idiom, i.e. the way we code in Julia
is similar to *plain* programming.
